# Lab-Demo-Recordings


## Lab Recordings and Demos

The videos in this repo were originally published as alternatives to completing hands-on exercises in Azure during the initial stages of the Covid 19 pandemic, when Azure resources were constrained to support high-priority workloads. 
These constraints have now been removed, and the videos are no longer maintained or supported.
The intent is to provide Microsoft Certified Trainers an easy way to access a non-audio version recording of hands-on labs used in the portfolio.
